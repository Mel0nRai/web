                <div class = "site2"> When I first entered university, I didn't have much knowledge of coding or programming, but I decided to learn it and pursue my computing career. I was worried about my lack of computer skills in my early lessons, but I quickly overcame these problems by doing my research with the help of the internet, professor, and colleagues. Our teacher helped us learn  module lessons in a playful and easy-to-understand way. Learning modules seemed like a new experience for me, but it was fun and modules were easy to learn. My interest in computing has increased over time. <br> <br>
					When I first heard about the assignment, I was excited and decided to do my best to get  good grades, but when I started the assignment, there were a lot of things I didn't understand and there were a lot of programming errors and bugs. I was worried, but after discussing with my classmates and professor, I eventually overcame those errors. The internet and YouTube also played a big role in helping me complete my assignment. Since I started working on my assignment, I've learned a lot about HTML and CSS to make my work more attractive and aesthetically pleasing. <br> <br>
					I used quite a lot of photos in my assignment because I wanted to make it look attractive and eye-catching to others. I linked all web pages in HTML using href tags and also used grid for portfolio, blog, and site report pages in CSS. On the contact page, I used the mailto tag to allow others to send me an email directly if necessary. I also used different fonts and colors for the assignments to make them look good. I also included a screenshot of each page's validation on the site report page using grid. After completing the HTML code, I used media queries in CSS to make the web page mobile-friendly. The guideline had the additional consideration of using a hamburger icon to hide the menu, but I couldn't create it due to lack of knowledge and because it wasn't taught in the module lesson.  </div>
